Santa Barbara, also known as the American Riviera, boasts one of the most pleasant year-round climates in the country. Temperatures range from the mid-60s to mid-70s Fahrenheit throughout the year, though late summer highs climb into the 80s Fahrenheit. Evening temperatures are refreshingly cool all year long. The area receives about 18 inches (46 cm) of rainfall a year.

Santa Barbara County is famous around the world for its breathtaking setting. Natural beauty beams from the dramatic mix of mountains, valleys, beaches, islands, and the sea. Inspired perhaps by this ravishing scenery, Santa Barbara County's cultural arts scene is one of our star attractions. You can enjoy world-class performances of music, opera, dance, and theater year round. Santa Barbara is also a hotbed for the visual arts with a reputation as one of the top five art colonies in the West.

Santa Barbara is famous for its beautiful beaches, most of which lie along a unique south-facing stretch of coastline that affords beach visitors sun all day long and greater shelter from winds and surf than many other coastal beaches. But there’s far more here than beaches. The county encompasses enormously varied terrain: nearly one-third of its total acreage is set aside in the Los Padres National Forest, which includes the rugged San Rafael Wilderness Area. Santa Barbara County’s topographical diversity creates a huge variety of outdoor recreational opportunities in a relatively compact area.

Experience the legacies of Santa Barbara’s colorful history. See our rich Spanish heritage in the city’s distinctive architecture, the cobbled pathways, red tile roofs, and mission-style adobes. Explore the western-style towns of Los Olivos and Santa Ynez or relive the county's cultural history at one of our many fascinating museums. Visit the quaint Danish village of Solvang with its windmills and timbered Tudor facades. In Santa Barbara County, history whispers from every corner.
