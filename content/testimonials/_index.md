      [VRBO Bear stayed here](https://www.vrbo.com/151084) - on site review:
      This is a truly magnificent luxury Santa Barbara oceanfront property with
      tremendous attention to detail and terrific owners. The pictures on the
      website hardly do it justice – the views are stunning, and the traditional
      Cape Cod architecture of the home strikes a perfect balance between casual
      and stylish. We went with three couples and there was plenty of room for
      everyone. Each couple had a room with beautiful ocean views and
      top-quality bedding. The house is very well outfitted with entertainment
      systems, furnishings, books, and all the amenities needed for cooking and
      enjoying the home. The gourmet kitchen is of the highest quality, worthy
      of any chef, and includes a large farm table situated against the backdrop
      of the wonderful ocean views. The house is located on a steep cliff, with
      stair access to the beach about 50 yards down the road. We saw whales,
      dolphins and seals during our visit.


      The owners were fantastic – greeting us at the airport and taking care of
      our every need – including the provision of extra bicycles, the
      arrangement of a wine tour, and a chef that prepared snacks for our
      arrival and an amazing multi-course dinner during one of our three nights
      in the home. The property is a short drive into downtown Santa Barbara (a
      couple of us biked into town from the house) which offers lots of shopping
      and restaurants. But overall the house is pretty tough to leave with its
      many amenities including an outdoor fire pit overlooking the ocean, hot
      tub, swimming pool, and extensive game room with a pool table, video
      games, and the completely addicting “Earthshaker” pinball machine. It also
      has an amazing movie theatre…which we used several times…it really felt
      like getting away to the movies with true theatre-quality sound and video.


      This is an expensive rental, but one where you’ll get what you pay for. It
      is as luxurious as any 5-star hotel with the space and comfort for one or
      two large families. We didn’t bring the kids, but they would have really
      enjoyed it. Parents with small kids might be a little paranoid about the
      bluff, so be prepared to be on guard if your children are overly curious
      in this regard. Overall we’d rate this one an easy “10” and recommend it
      unequivocally! Thanks so much!

      I feel so fortunate that you chose to share this treasure with others. 
      Our group of 8 celebrated my 50th birthday here.  Coming from Chicago, it
      took some getting used to living with the doors & windows open (no bugs!
      It’s great!) So many wonderful memories: the quietness of the ocean in the
      morning, the Heineken on tap, candles lit at dusk, the stocked wine
      cellar, Harold’s dinner on the patio, golfing, the wine tasting tour,
      kayaking with the sea lions, the awesome master bath shower, music
      throughout the house, tremendous bon fires every night, swimming against
      the current in the pool, watching TV in the hot tub, fireplaces
      everywhere, sunbathing on the deck, breakfast with the ocean’s cliffs,
      bike riding to the café, most importantly – the tremendous service
      provided by Ben & Matt, and the setting that helped eight friends grow
      closer and deeper in friendship.  For that, I am most certainly grateful.
      Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

      As I write this I am sitting in the best seat of the house – the end chair
      at the kitchen table looking out over the backyard and the Santa Barbara
      Coastline!  We have wonderful memories of our time here – dinners on the
      deck with Harold; watching the pelicans fly over; kayaking out to visit
      the sea lions; hiking to Knapps Castle with our son, daughter in law &
      grandson; playing golf at La Cumbre; mani’s and pedi’s in the privacy of
      SBBC; watching Brandon feed the fish; movies in the theater; biking on the
      bike trails; buying Californian art & meeting the artists; eating @
      fabulous restaurants… Many thanks for helping us make these memories.  All
      of our best to you and your family.

      Our time here with friends & family has been wonderful. I can't imagine a
      more perfect setting or a house that reflects & draws in that beauty any
      better. All the details, such as the beach toys, refreshments and skin
      care products just added to the feeling of being pampered. This past week
      we celebrated an eighty-second birthday and a proposal & engagement. We
      also experiences some hospital time when our friend& guest had emergency
      surgery for a ruptured appendix. But even he was able to have a day here
      to recoup and rest in this beautiful place. Thank you for sharing it with
      us. May God bless you & all who come here.

      We all had the most amazing time here!  There was nothing missing and all
      of our expectations were surpassed. We loved all the attention to detail
      around the house and could not have asked for more.  It was a family trip
      that we will never forget, and are so happy we were able to spend that
      time together in this beautiful home.  It was very nice meeting you and
      your beautiful family and hope to see you soon!  With love.
